Explanation:
• Although many “operating‐based” earnings numbers are discussed in the MD&A, the reported consolidated income statement for the quarter shows total net revenue of approximately $7,748 million, net income of approximately $1,628 million, and basic earnings per share of about $0.80. 
• In our analysis we computed an “operating margin” – a percentage expressing “operating income” relative to revenue – using the figure “Income before income tax expense” of about $2,430 million divided by total revenue ($7,748 million) which gives (2430/7748)*100 ≈ 31.38%.
• All numbers are expressed with two significant digits after the decimal point and in the appropriate units.
